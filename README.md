Mazy Dungeon
==========

A game about finding a way through a maze of dungeons.

Rooms have spikes and doors where player has to use a switch to open certain door. Player has to avoid spikes - has info like in minesweeper (number of spikes near floor tile). The room is covered with fog of war - discovering floor tiles and collecting coins gives points.
